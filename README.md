Kahmin's Portfolio :D This is my portfolio, in here, I will be telling you things about me, my works and as well as how to contact me!

Design Process This website was built to showcase to my future employers/any audience who wishes to see my work and about myself, to show what works I have done and what I am capable of doing. I also want to make this page as simple as possible so that my audience won't have a problem while going through it.

As an Immersive Media student, I would like to be able to showcase my own works, so that I can be able to achive the dream job I want which is an illustrator for games. I am still learning and hoping to improve my portfolio as the time goes by.

My page can also be used on different browsers as well as mobile phones and tablets, this is due to the media querie which allows the page to be responsive.
